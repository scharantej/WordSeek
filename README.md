## Flask Application Design: Make a Word Search Game in a 4x4 Grid

### Introduction
- To construct a Flask-based word search game, we need to design an application that generates a game board and serves a page where players can traverse the grid, find words, and submit them.

### HTML Files
- `index.html`: Consists of the primary interface for the game. It features the game board, a submission form for words, and a section to display the status of the game.
- `grid.html`: A template that creates the game board dynamically, based on the dimensions specified in the view function. Contains logic to handle cell clicks and highlight selected words.
- `styles.css`: A styling file to enhance the visual appearance of the game.

### Routes
1. **`/`**:
   - Purpose: Serves the main game page, `index.html`.
   - Functionality: In the view function, it creates a game board by calling a helper function. Then, it passes the game board to the `index.html` template for rendering.
2. **`/validate_word`**:
   - Purpose: Validates the submitted word against the game board.
   - Functionality: The view function takes the player's input, checks if the word exists in the game board, and returns a JSON response indicating the validity of the word.
3. **`/reset_game`**:
   - Purpose: Resets the game by generating a new board and clearing submitted words.
   - Functionality: The view function clears any existing game state, creates a new game board, and redirects the player to the `/` route to start a fresh game.

### User Interaction
- Players will interact with the game by clicking on cells within the grid.
- Selecting a cell marks it as the starting point for word validation.
- Players can continue selecting cells vertically or horizontally to extend the word they're attempting to find.
- The game board will highlight the selected cells to visually indicate the word being formed.
- When a player is satisfied with their attempt, they can submit the word through a provided form, triggering a validation process.
- The application will validate the submitted word using a function that checks if it exists within the game board and returns feedback to the player in real-time.

### Conclusion
- This Flask application offers a simple but engaging word search game where users can discover words within a dynamically generated grid.
- The game features validation of submitted words, a reset option, and a visually interactive game board.
